## Hello, World!

### About Me

My name is Isaac, and I am an graduate student studying GIS and Data Science. In addition to GIS and DS, I studied computer science for my bachelor's degree. My other interests include language learning (both programming and natural languages), history, photography, and science - both fact and fiction!
